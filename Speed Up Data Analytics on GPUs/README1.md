- Set up a cloud environment: Configure and connect to a GPU-accelerated runtime using Colab Enterprise runtime templates.
- Accelerate pandas instantly: Use cuDF to accelerate pandas code without modification.
- Benchmark performance: Run a data analytics pipeline on both CPU and GPU to quantify and visualize the speedups.
- Integrate with cloud storage: Practice reading and writing large Parquet datasets at high speed directly from and to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

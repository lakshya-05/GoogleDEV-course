During training, the model learns to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This process involves a **forward pass**, where input data is propagated through the network to generate predictions, followed by a **backward pass**, in which gradients of a loss function with respect to the model parameters are computed. An **optimizer** then uses these gradients to adjust the model parameters iteratively, minimizing the loss and improving the model’s predictive accuracy.\n","\n","Once training is complete, the model enters the inference phase, where it is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
